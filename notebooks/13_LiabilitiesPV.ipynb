Even though cash is a \"safe asset\" in the sense that the asset value does not go down, cash can be a very risky asset because the value of the liabilities goes up when interest rates go down. Therefore, if you think about your savings in terms of funding ratio (i.e. how much money do you have compared to what you need) then cash is a risky asset and can result in a decline in your funding ratio."
